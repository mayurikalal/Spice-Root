## Environment Files

`client/.env` only contains public `VITE_` values.

`server/.env` contains private service keys and Razorpay secrets. Never deploy private keys to Vercel or expose them in client code.

For the visible Razorpay demo/test gateway with the current keys, keep `RAZORPAY_MOCK_MODE=true` in `server/.env`. The user still sees Razorpay Checkout, and the order is saved after the successful test payment callback.

If you regenerate a valid Razorpay test key secret and want full server-created Razorpay orders with signature verification, set `RAZORPAY_MOCK_MODE=false`.

During local development, the server accepts Vite origins from `localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, and private LAN IPs such as `http://10.x.x.x:5173`. In production, set `CLIENT_ORIGIN` to the deployed Vercel URL.

## Deployment

Deploy the client to Vercel from the repository root using `vercel.json`.

Direct routes such as `/admin/login` require the included Vercel SPA rewrite. Redeploy after changing `vercel.json` or `client/vercel.json`.

Deploy the server to Render with `server` as the root directory.

Set `VITE_API_URL` in Vercel to your Render API URL:

```txt
https://your-render-service.onrender.com/api
```

Set `CLIENT_ORIGIN` in Render to your Vercel domain:

```txt
https://your-vercel-domain.vercel.app
```
